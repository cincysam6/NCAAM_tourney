## List of potential improvements for the model

1) Incorporate the pre-season ranks
2) Incorporate some more advanced analytic metrics for basketball
3) Add data from the conference tournament/Add a last 30 days variable to account for momentum
4) Don't mess with a lot of the box stats, they don't seem all that predictive.
5) Make sure we don't overfit on Kenpom or Seeds 
6) Come up with some more diagnostic metrics and base rates to see how well calibrated the model is
